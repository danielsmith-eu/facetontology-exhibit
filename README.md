facetontology-exhibit
=====================

Use FacetOntology definitions to create Exhibits

Run run.sh to generate output into `exhibit/`
It will create an example using the iPlayer data from `http://iplayer.mspace.fm`

Run a web server to see the resulting exhibit, e.g.:

    cd exhibit
    python -mSimpleHTTPServer

Then browse to http://localhost:8000
